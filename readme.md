## üìã About

### A simple project designed to shuffle workgroups for each new brief.

This tool ensures that teams are regularly mixed up, promoting fresh collaboration for every new task. By automatically reorganizing groups with each assignment, it helps maintain diversity and prevent teams from becoming repetitive. Perfect for classrooms, corporate environments, or any situation where changing team dynamics is important, this project makes sure each brief is approached with a new combination of people.

## üí° Motivation

My motivation was to streamline the group-mixing process, allowing it to happen more quickly and efficiently. This way, we can maximize the productivity of training days, ensuring that more time is spent on learning and collaboration rather than organizing teams.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Tech used

This project follows the "cowboy coding" method, a bold, fast-paced approach often credited to @HachemiH. It embraces spontaneity and quick decision-making, prioritizing rapid development and flexibility over formal processes.
